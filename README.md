# Retinal-Vessel-Segmentation-DRIVE
A demonstration of a classical image-processing pipeline—green-channel extraction, CLAHE contrast enhancement, Frangi vessel filtering, Otsu thresholding, and morphological cleanup—to automatically segment retinal blood vessels in fundus images. Includes a step-by-step Jupyter notebook and a batch-processing Python script on the DRIVE dataset.
